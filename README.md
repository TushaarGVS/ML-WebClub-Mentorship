Machine Learning is one of the trending and interesting topics of Computer-Science, falling under the category of `Artificial Intelligence`.
Machine Learning:
- 
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

The logs aim at providing a grip over the various concepts and aspects of Machine Learning:
- What is `Machine Learning` ?
- What is `Supervised Learning` and What is `Unsupervised Learning` ? (Reinforced Learning)
- What is `Regression` and What is `Classification` ?
- What is `Linear Regression` with one variable, two variables ?
- What is `Gradient-Descent` ?
- What is `Logistic Regression` ?
- What is a `Support Vector Machine` (SVM) ?
- What is  `K Nearest Neighbors` (KNN) Algorithm ?

Along with various Machine Learning concepts presented, `Python Programming` (Code) necessary for Data Science is also included.
