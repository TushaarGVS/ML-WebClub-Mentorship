20:40 <tushaar__> Welcome to the Web-Club's Winter Mentorship Programme 2016.
20:41 <tushaar__> Okay first of all, we'll discuss what ML is?
20:41 < tushaar__> Anyone?
20:41 < tushaar__> Agenda: 
20:42 < tushaar__> Basics of ML.
20:42 < tushaar__> Supervised Learning (Unsupervised Learning, Reinforced Learning also).
20:42 < tushaar__> Regression and Linear Regression with one variable.
20:42 -!- Aman_ [2f086bf8@gateway/web/freenode/ip.47.8.107.248] has joined #wc-ml1
20:42 < tushaar__> We will be covering these 3 topics in today’s session.
20:43 < tushaar__> No one? 
20:43 < tushaar__> People respond. What is ML?
20:43 < Myk_> no idea.
20:43 < tushaar__> Okay
20:43 < tushaar__> Technically, it is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
20:43 < Myk_> is it related with AI
20:43 < tushaar__> Absolutely.
20:44 < tushaar__> A more formal way of saying the same would be:
20:45 < tushaar__> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 
20:46 < tushaar__> any questions?
20:47 < Myk_> nope
20:47 < ganesh_> no carry on
20:47 < Aman_> please elaborate..
20:47 < Aman_> like...wth examples
20:47 < tushaar__> See, if I want my computer to perform some task, what do I do?
20:47 < tushaar__> I program it.
20:47 -!- Aryanhimanshu [a995adf4@gateway/web/freenode/ip.169.149.173.244] has joined #wc-ml1
20:48 < Aman_> okay..
20:48 < tushaar__> Instead, if my computer itself decides the best alternative from the past records or experience
20:48 < tushaar__> It is called machine learning.
20:49 < Aman_> ok..fine..
20:49 < tushaar__> The performance or probability is what that matters to us
20:49 < tushaar__> Consider the Example: Playing checkers.
20:49 < tushaar__> E = the experience of playing many games of checkers.
20:50 < tushaar__> T = the task of playing checkers.
20:50 < tushaar__> P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
20:50 < tushaar__> clear? @Aman?
20:50 < Aman_> yes yes... :)
20:50 < tushaar__> Cool
20:50 < tushaar__> anyone any doubts?
20:51 < Aman_> no..not till now
20:51 < Aryanhimanshu> I missed the beginning part 
20:51 < Myk_> no carry on
20:51 < Myk_> yepp
20:51 < Aryanhimanshu> Can you send the log for that?
20:51 < bharath> no
20:51 < Myk_> u were late :P
20:51 < Aryanhimanshu> Okay
20:52 < tushaar__> Yeah sure @Aryanhimanshu
20:52 < hkagrawal1994> no pblm 
20:52 < tushaar__> So, from the discussion we infer that, Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data.
20:53 < Aryanhimanshu> Ok
20:53 < tushaar__> So, now that we are familiar with what ML actually is, let's move forward.
20:53 < Aman_> thats what AI..? no..?
20:53 < tushaar__> In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
20:53 < tushaar__> Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
20:54 < tushaar__> Yes :) @Aman
20:54 < Aman_> ok..
20:55 < tushaar__> Any clue about Supervised learning?
20:55 < tushaar__> Anyone?
20:55 < Aman_> there must be some supervisor..i think..
20:56 < Myk_> which works under supervision 😊 
20:56 < tushaar__> Both of you are kinda correct, take a look at this:
20:56 < tushaar__> https://ibin.co/3589s0n4gA0u.png
20:57 -!- epic7joe [b959f915@gateway/web/freenode/ip.185.89.249.21] has joined #wc-ml1
20:58 < tushaar__> Have all of you seen the Housing price prediction?
20:58 < Session> yes
20:59 < tushaar__> So, tell me now, what do you understand from the graph?
20:59 < bharath> yes
21:00 < Session> how house prices vary with size
21:00 < tushaar__> Correct.
21:00 < tushaar__> Consider the following example:
21:00 < tushaar__> Say, one of your friends wants to sell a house of 750 square feet, how can we help him?
21:00 -!- Myk_ [2ff7aa53@gateway/web/freenode/ip.47.247.170.83] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
21:01 < Session> cen tell himthe price referring to the graph
21:01 < tushaar__> Elaborate @Session
21:02 < tushaar__> Please be more interactive
21:02 < tushaar__> @all
21:02 < Session> prices for sizes close to 750 is clearly indicated. by taking some sort of weighted average, we can infer the price for 750 sq.ft
21:03 < tushaar__> Perfect @Session
21:03 < tushaar__> But, let's see all the possibilities.
21:03 < tushaar__> Now take a look at: https://ibin.co/358Af1vA81HH.png
21:04 < tushaar__> Simple solution would be to build a learning algorithm, that may be a straight line or a quadratic as depicted in the diagram. 
21:05 < Aman_> yes..the quadratic is more accurate
21:05 < tushaar__>  Here plotting a straight line would show us that the house can be sold for $160,000.
21:05 -!- Myk_ [1b61c834@gateway/web/freenode/ip.27.97.200.52] has joined #wc-ml1
21:05 < tushaar__> Infact at a later stage we decide to stick to the quadratic line rather than the straight line, then the house can be sold for $200,000.
21:06 < Session> is the quadratic better as it covers more data points?
21:06 < tushaar__> Irrespective of price, both these learning algorithms are fine examples of superviesed learning.
21:06 < Aman_> and near to actual points as well..
21:07 < Session> ok
21:07 < tushaar__> No, we cannot decide anything.
21:07 < tushaar__> Here the question wasn't to maximize the profits
21:07 < tushaar__> it was to find a learning algorithm to satify the needs.
21:08 < Aman_> okay..
21:08 < tushaar__> another learning algorithm would be to join all the points and precisely find out the answer, in $
21:08 < tushaar__> This indeed is an example of Supervised Learning, which here refers to the fact that we gave the algorithm to a data set in which the "right answers" were given.
21:09 < tushaar__> Means that all we did was that we devised an algorithm that just computes an answer where few right answers are already given.
21:10 < tushaar__>  That is, we were given a data set of houses in which for every example in this data set, we were given the right price (500 - $100,000, 1000 - $200,000).
21:10 < tushaar__> So based on the given right answers we just devised an algorithm that gave us required results.
21:10 < Myk_> like computing relationship between data and answer
21:11 < tushaar__> Ofcourse
21:11 < tushaar__> Some thing like you're already given the answer but in different form.
21:12 < tushaar__> Any doubts up till now?
21:12 < Session> no
21:13 < tushaar__> Hey people respond!
21:13 -!- Aman__ [2f086bf8@gateway/web/freenode/ip.47.8.107.248] has joined #wc-ml1
21:13 < Aryanhimanshu> Ok till now
21:13 < venkat> no
21:13 < tushaar__> That's good.
21:14 -!- hkagrawal1994 [2f086463@gateway/web/freenode/ip.47.8.100.99] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
21:14 < tushaar__> Now pay attention towards our next problem: https://ibin.co/358AthiyKmyB.png
21:14 < tushaar__> Reference: A malignant tumor is a tumor that is harmful and dangerous and a benign tumor is a tumor that is harmless.
21:14 < bharath> no
21:15 < tushaar__> In the figure, Y-yes and N-no.
21:16 < tushaar__> Did all of you have a look at the Breast Cancer data-set?
21:16 < Session> yes
21:16 < epic7joe> yes
21:16 < tushaar__> Now, tell me what do you observe from this data set?
21:17 < tushaar__> also tell me what difference do you find between this data-set and the one presented earlier?
21:17 < Session> chances of tumor being malignant increases with size
21:17 -!- Aman__ [2f086bf8@gateway/web/freenode/ip.47.8.107.248] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
21:17 < epic7joe> as tumour size increases chance that it is malignant increses
21:17 < tushaar__> Good observation but not quite what I was looking for
21:18 -!- Rahul [2f086bf8@gateway/web/freenode/ip.47.8.107.248] has joined #wc-ml1
21:18 < tushaar__> Answer to second question?
21:18 -!- Rahul is now known as Guest81956
21:18 < Session> y axis has ony 2 options
21:19 < tushaar__> Good going.
21:19 < tushaar__> And?
21:19 < Myk_> they may be either maligant
21:19 < Myk_> that means
21:19 < Myk_> harmfull
21:19 < Myk_> and dangerous
21:19 < tushaar__> Okay, so?
21:20 < epic7joe> after a particular size chance that tumour is malignant is high
21:20 < Myk_> if its not maligant
21:20 < tushaar__> Not that
21:20 < Session> tumors start getting malignant only after a certain size
21:20 < tushaar__> Let us move on.
21:20 < tushaar__> The second data set presented to you has only 2 possibilities.
21:20 < tushaar__> right>
21:21 < Session> yes
21:21 < tushaar__> either malignant or benign.
21:21 < Myk_> yes
21:21 < tushaar__> while the first data set doesnot have restrictions
21:21 < tushaar__> Hence the first one is a continuous data set
21:22 < tushaar__> While the second one is a Discrete data set.
21:22 < tushaar__> Agreed?
21:22 < bharath> yes
21:22 < Guest81956> Yes
21:22 < epic7joe> yeah
21:22 < tushaar__> Have a look at thid: https://ibin.co/358B4dEmugst.png
21:22 < Session> is even the size of tumor discrete?
21:22 < tushaar__>  circle denote benign tumors and cross denote malignant tumors. 
21:22 < tushaar__> in the figure
21:23 < tushaar__> nope @session
21:23 < tushaar__> we are really not worried about the size of tumor, you see the green arrow?
21:23 < Myk_> yes
21:24 < Myk_> its like seprator
21:24 < tushaar__> We really would like to estimate the possibilities of him/her having cancer
21:24 < tushaar__> So, we really fixed our tumor size
21:24 < tushaar__> We are only worried about our Y-axis values
21:25 < tushaar__> Understood @session?
21:25 < Session> yes
21:25 < tushaar__> You guys agree that both the figures (the last two) are the same.
21:25 < tushaar__> right?
21:25 < Session> yes
21:25 < Myk_> yes
21:25 < epic7joe> yes
21:26 < Aman_> yes
21:26 < tushaar__> So, when we have discrete values we can represent them based on the attributes they depend on
21:26 < tushaar__> like here it depends on the tumor size.
21:26 < tushaar__> Any doubts so far?
21:26 < epic7joe> nope
21:26 < Myk_> no
21:26 < bharath> no
21:27 < venkat> no
21:27 < tushaar__> Lets get a bit technical here.
21:27 < Aman_> nope
21:27 < tushaar__> Example1 (Housing) is indeed a problem of Regression.
21:27 < tushaar__> Example2 (Cancer) is a problem of Classification.
21:28 < tushaar__> we can infer that Example-1 is clearly dealing with continuous values while Example-2 deals with discrete values (0 or 1). Simply put, the machine learning problems dealing with continuous values are technically, Regression Problems while the problems dealing with discrete values are Classification Problems (there may be more than 2 values).
21:28 < tushaar__> Clear?
21:29 < Session> yes
21:29 < Myk_> yes
21:29 < epic7joe> yes
21:29 < bharath> yes
21:29 < tushaar__> Good
21:29 -!- Guest81956 [2f086bf8@gateway/web/freenode/ip.47.8.107.248] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
21:29 < tushaar__> Now going back to our problem, note that our problem is one-attribute based
21:30 < tushaar__> we need not have one-attribute always, we can have more than one
21:30 < tushaar__> have a look: https://ibin.co/358BH7XR0CsV.png
21:31 < tushaar__> In the diagram, you can clearly see that the cancer tendency depends both on age as well as tumor size. 
21:31 < tushaar__> agreed?
21:31 < Session> yes
21:32 < epic7joe> yeah
21:32 < Myk_> yes
21:32 < bharath> yes
21:32 < ganesh_> yes
21:32 < tushaar__> Now I want to determine what the yellow dot falls under?
21:33 < tushaar__> Say he has cancer.
21:33 < tushaar__> How to create a model that determines such cases?
21:33 < tushaar__> Any ideas?
21:34 < tushaar__> circle denote benign tumors and cross denote malignant tumors. 
21:35 < Myk_> with the help of  attributes.!!
21:36 < tushaar__> More precisely as such: https://ibin.co/358BUXua06N6.png
21:36 < tushaar__> Take a look.
21:36 < tushaar__> In order to predict we can draw a straight line that seperates the two and we may say that the probability of having breast cancer is more above the line.
21:37 < tushaar__> Got it?
21:37 < Aman_> yes..
21:37 < Myk_> more?
21:37 < epic7joe> yeah
21:37 < Myk_> they are two types of cancer na ?
21:37 < bharath> yes
21:37 < tushaar__> more? as in
21:38 < Myk_> u said probability would be more above the line
21:38 < tushaar__> Yeah, can you see that there is a circle above the line
21:38 < Myk_> yes
21:38 < tushaar__> and a cross below the line
21:38 < Myk_> yes
21:39 < tushaar__> if cross is mailgnant, what is the probability of breast cancer occurance above the line?
21:39 < tushaar__> is it more or less?
21:39 < Session> more
21:39 < tushaar__> Understand?
21:39 < Myk_> but the other one is also a type of Brest cancer..
21:40 < tushaar__> No, it is a type of tumor, that is harmless.
21:40 < Aman_> but above line probability of circle is very less...
21:40 < Session> no..other one is just a tumor
21:40 < tushaar__> Got it?
21:40 < Myk_> ohh
21:40 < tushaar__> Now, So, for each of these problems, they should be treated as a classification problem, or as a regression problem.
21:40 < tushaar__> Agree?
21:40 < Aman_> yes..less harmfull and more harmfull..ok..
21:41 < Myk_> circle is tumor and cross is cancer
21:41 < Myk_> ?
21:41 < tushaar__> Yeah (not really)
21:41 < tushaar__> Reference: A malignant tumor is a tumor that is harmful and dangerous and a benign tumor is a tumor that is harmless.
21:41 < Myk_> okay
21:41 < tushaar__> circle denote benign tumors and cross denote malignant tumors. 
21:41 < Myk_> got it
21:41 < Aman_> ;-)
21:42 < tushaar__> Cool now move on to: So, for each of these learning problems, they should be treated as a classification problem, or as a regression problem.
21:42 < tushaar__> Agree?
21:42 < Myk_> yess
21:43 < tushaar__> Because data is either discrete or continuous.
21:43 < Aman_> okay..
21:43 < tushaar__> Now, time for some brain-food:
21:43 < tushaar__> Problem 1: You have a large inventory of identical items. You want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next 3 months.
21:43 < tushaar__> Problem 2: You’d like software to examine individual customer accounts, and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised. 
21:44 < tushaar__> I want all of you to answer to both the questions as to which model is to be used?
21:44 < tushaar__> Regression or Classification?
21:44 < Myk_> first one is regression 
21:44 < Myk_> second is classification 
21:44 < ganesh_> second is a classification
21:45 < epic7joe> 1- regression
21:45 < Session> 1 - regression
21:45 < epic7joe> 2 - classification
21:45 < Session> 2 - classification
21:45 < Aman_> yes...second in classification..
21:45 < tushaar__> Perfect
21:45 < tushaar__> I hope you guys know why.
21:46 < Myk_> yes 
21:46 < bharath> yes
21:46 < Session> yes
21:46 < Aman_> yeah
21:46 < tushaar__> 1 - Continuous data and 2 - Discrete data
21:46 < ganesh_> bcoz second has discrete data...i think
21:46 < tushaar__> Correct @ganesh
21:47 < ganesh_> ok
21:47 < Myk_> first have same items
21:47 < tushaar__> Now, have you wondered, what unsupervised learning is?
21:47 < tushaar__> @Myk Elaborate?
21:48 < tushaar__> I think you might have misunderstood.
21:48 < ganesh_> so what is being continuous in 1st
21:49 < Myk_> i think its like
21:49 < Session> number of items to be sold is y axis and time taken is x axis i think
21:49 < Myk_> on the basis of attributes 
21:49 < Myk_> it will tell us weather 
21:49 < tushaar__> See, on a particular day, in those 3 months you cannot say as to how many goods will be sold, can you?
21:50 < Myk_> it will tell answer on the basis of attributes
21:50 < Myk_> here we are not providing answer
21:50 < tushaar__> Correct @Myk
21:50 < Myk_> 😊 
21:51 < tushaar__> But can you tell me exactly tell me how many products are sold exactly on day-n 
21:51 < tushaar__> we cannot. While in case 2 - it is either hacked or compromised.
21:52 < tushaar__> Get it?
21:52 < ganesh_> yes
21:52 < epic7joe> yeah
21:52 < tushaar__> Cool, let us see, Unsupervised learning.
21:53 < tushaar__> Take a look at: https://ibin.co/358BfmmYsYeB.png
21:53 -!- Aman_ [2f086bf8@gateway/web/freenode/ip.47.8.107.248] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
21:53 < tushaar__> Find any difference between the previously sent images and this one>
21:53 < tushaar__> *?
21:54 < Myk_> here we dont have any type 
21:54 < Myk_> only
21:54 < Myk_> circles
21:54 < tushaar__> You got it.
21:54 < tushaar__> Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data.
21:55 < tushaar__> Got it?
21:55 < Myk_> without labeled response means
21:56 < tushaar__> You have no clue as to what data set has been provided to you, the only inference that can be drawn from these are patterns and clusters. 
21:57 < Myk_> okay
21:57 < tushaar__> You donot have the foggiest idea of X1 and X2.
21:57 < tushaar__> Got it?
21:57 -!- aryanhimanshu_ [7cfd08e7@gateway/web/freenode/ip.124.253.8.231] has joined #wc-ml1
21:57 < Myk_> yes
21:57 -!- Aryanhimanshu [a995adf4@gateway/web/freenode/ip.169.149.173.244] has left #wc-ml1 []
21:57 < tushaar__> Now the only inference that can be drawn from this is: https://ibin.co/358BstnXZfOd.png
21:58 < tushaar__> Have a look, do you guys agree?
21:58 < Myk_> ues
21:58 < Myk_> yes
21:58 < Myk_> bt suppose if we label these attributes 
21:58 < Session> yes
21:58 < tushaar__> Hence, we categorize this data-set by clustering it into 2 groups or clusters (here).
21:59 < Myk_> what difference it will make
21:59 < tushaar__> We need to figure out the relation between X1 and X2 to label them.
21:59 < tushaar__> Get it?
22:00 < Myk_> if we had  a relation and label than also
22:00 < Myk_> we can only conclude about cluster
22:00 < Myk_> here
22:00 < tushaar__> Yes here
22:00 < tushaar__> only here
22:00 < Myk_> so here label doesn't matter
22:00 < tushaar__> Not always it is the case
22:01 < tushaar__> Here
22:01 < Myk_> okay
22:01 < tushaar__> But generally if you have labels and then you can build a model like the first example
22:01 < tushaar__> get it?
22:02 < tushaar__> Hence here we categorize this data-set by clustering it into 2 groups or clusters (here).
22:02 < Myk_> 👍 
22:02 < Session> okay
22:02 < tushaar__> Cool, Now, do you guys want me to start Regression and Linear Regression?
22:03 < tushaar__> Or shall we stop here?
22:03 < aryanhimanshu_> yaa go on
22:03 < Myk_> i think that's enough for today
22:03 < bharath> we shall stop here
22:04 < ganesh_> yes we should stop here
22:04 < tushaar__> As you wish, we'll pick from here in the following session.
22:04 < Myk_> 😃 
22:04 < tushaar__> Before we wind up, take a look at: https://s27.postimg.org/7v3qhp2tf/image.png.
22:04 < tushaar__> This is Unsupervised Learning because we're not telling the algorithm in advance that these are type 1 people, those are type 2 persons, those are type 3 persons and so on and instead what were saying is yeah here's a bunch of data. 
22:04 < tushaar__> I don't know what's in this data. I don't know who's and what type. 
22:04 < tushaar__> I don't even know what the different types of people are, but can you automatically find structure in the data from the you automatically cluster the individuals into these types that I don't know in advance? 
22:05 < tushaar__> Because we're not giving the algorithm the right answer for the examples in my data set, this is Unsupervised Learning.
22:05 < tushaar__> References: Tom M. Mitchell, Machine Learning, McGraw-Hill, 1997
22:05 < tushaar__> With this we will wind up our first session and hope you guys had fun.
22:05 < tushaar__> We’ll look at Regression,Linear Regression in one variable, Gradient Descent and Logistic Regression in the next session..
22:05 < tushaar__> Go through the concepts for better understanding.
22:06 < tushaar__> Thank you all for attending the session.
